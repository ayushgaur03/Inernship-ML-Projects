# Recommender System

This is a project done for the internship of ACM IIT,Dhanbad. In this project, I developed a recommend-er system which recommends us movies based on users ratings and the movie's genres.

It is a content based model which means that it recommends you movies based on the genres and ratings given to each movie by the user. I have used specific datasets for
my model to work. You can checkout the datasets in this repository.

To prepare this model, I have used KNN Algorithm.
